  About this site
</h1>
<p>
  On this page I'll be posting excerpts of my work done in my free time. As the subtitle says this whole page is related to IT specific topics. Posts will include descriptions and examples from my projects I'm currently working on. Also, there will be specific things I've spotted while studying and deemed as interesting.
</p>
<p>
As I'm not a native english speaker you might find errors in my text. You can e-mail me a hint or, even easier, submit a pull request with a fix at the <a href="https://github.com/1dollarsteak/1dollarsteak.github.io">github repository</a> for this site, since it's hosted on Github Pages. I'll try to add a german translation to my posts as soon as I figured out a way to switch languages easily.
