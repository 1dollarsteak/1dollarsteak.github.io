This is a simple post to start with. The title says: "Hello, World!". It's like that because that's where I started with, when learning new programming languages. I also like picturing this phrase as a fresh hatched duckling, ready to experience what the world has to offer.

The purpose of this post is to finally get content on my site and to see how it looks without these common filler texts. Also I just finished my overview [page](/blog.html) and wanted to test if it works the way I want.

Let's see where this leads.
