As I want to advance my skills in managing Linux systems. I want to dive into
some software that's used quite regularly (I guess) in server environments.
On the internet, there exists a pretty good to do list for the curious. All
credit of this list goes to the User <User> on Reddit.
I've only made some minor modifications to it, so that it'll better fit my
needs.

## Overview
Generally speaking, the whole project consists of x steps and contains the
following topics/software:
- KVM
- System Management (Spacewalk & Puppet)
- Infrastructure (DNS, DHCP & LDAP)
- Backup
- E-Mail
- Monitoring
